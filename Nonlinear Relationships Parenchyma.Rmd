This R Markdown document aims to identify nonlinear relationships of a breast cancer data set from the [Study of Health in Pomerania](https://www.medizin.uni-greifswald.de/cm/fv/ship.html).

At first, load the data and give an overview over the target feature, which is the percentage of the parenchyma tissue in the female breast.

```{r}
# Load the data
path_to_data <- '/Users/paul/Workshop/Promotion/Data/Breast Fat Dataset/breast_fat_imageonly_labels.csv'
raw_data <- read.csv(path_to_data)
# The target variable is `Segmentation_ParenchymToVolume
summary(raw_data$Segmentation_ParenchymToVolume)
```
